### Always be Learning:  
During first three months of my career I understood the thing that, if I have to survive in this industry I need to always be learning. So I started with R Programming, I enjoyed it. Then I learned Scala because a friend was working on it. Finally, I decided to dig deep into Js and learning front end technologies like React and GraphQL.  

### Always be clear:  
I was the happy go lucky guy and was in the state that I understand everything. I was wrong. Beside that, I was a bad listener.  I had a bad habit not to schedule anything, and it was creating problems. What did I change? I became wise soon and changed below things—   
1. Scheduled my work tasks on starting of the day.   
2. I started giving “work done” timelines wisely by giving myself some time to  analyze what is required and how much time it will take to complete. I stopped promising people about a certain requirement without analyzing it.   
3. When I did not understand something I started asking for help. I stopped figuring out(stopped spending much time!) on things which were out of my league.(Follow this especially, when you are new)

### Make Side Projects:   
I created a GitHub account and started creating some side projects. This has helped me to build a good resume.

### Stay Away from Pessimists:   
I think this is most important thing to understand. I have met many such people who do not want to learn anything anymore because of age, job security and not laziness. Stay away from such people and find your own path. Instead follow people on twitter and medium and read their posts.
